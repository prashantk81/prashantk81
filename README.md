## ðŸŒŸ Projects

Here are some projects...

1. [TorrentMesh: P2P Group File Transfer System](https://github.com/prashantk81/Peer-to-Peer-Group-Based-File-Sharing-System):[ Socket Programming, Multi-threading, and SHA-256 ]
   - A P2P Group-based file-sharing system contains a bunch of functionalities like uploading and downloading.
2. [Automated and Distributed App Deployment Platform]:
   - Fully functional and automated platform supports any IoT-based application and is handled by many modules like application manager, deployment manager, node manager, sensor manager, and platform initializer.
   - Each service is running as an independent docker container and communicates via Kafka.
3. [Simple RA: A Relational Database](https://github.com/prashantk81/SimpleRA/tree/main):
   - Developed a mini relational database, focusing on operations like SORT, ORDER BY, JOIN, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions.
   - Also extended the functionalities to handle very large size matrix and matrix-based operations like LOAD-MATRIX and TRANSPOSE.
   - Improved database performance by eï¬ƒciently managing the number of pages/buï¬€ers used, reducing disk access, and external merge sort.
4. [BERT: Keyphrase Extraction Model]:
   - Developed a deep learning model that combines BERT embeddings and sentence transformers for accurate keyphrase extraction on Twitter data.
   - Achieved enhanced performance through the use of similarity metrics and BERT embeddings, ensuring retention of semantic and syntactic connectivity.
   - Takes an English language text as input and will return the keywords from the input text.
